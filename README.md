# Book Tracker

> #### [Live Demo Version](https://jfukura.github.io/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/)

## TL;DR

Clone, install, run:

* Clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/jfukura/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git`
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

> #### Note about Styles:
> The styles have been managed through SCSS using a file watcher in my IDE, so if styles need to be adjusted you may need to compile your own SCSS as I have not provided a mechanism to do that.

## How to use the app 
On initial load, you will be taken to the home page which has the shelves for the books. By clicking the icon in the lowe right of each book, you can change which shelf the book exists on.

Clicking the `+` icon in the lower right of the viewport will take you to the "add a new book" workflow where you can search for books.

While searching, any book that already exists in your library will be denoted by the icon that matches which shelf it is on. Books without a shelf, currently, have a plus icon, where you can select which shelf to put it on.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
